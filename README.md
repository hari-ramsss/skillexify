# Skillexify - Verifiable Technical Skill Credentials

Skillexify is a mobile-first app that leverages zkTLS and XION's on-chain infrastructure to verify and showcase real, tamper-proof technical skill credentials. It connects to platforms like LeetCode, GitHub, Kaggle, HackerRank, and Stack Overflow to pull verifiable data on a user's activity, rankings, contributions, and certifications — without compromising privacy.

With this data, Skillexify generates a "Proof of Skill" badge, stored immutably on-chain. Users can flex their verified expertise in competitive programming, open-source contributions, data science, and more — while recruiters and collaborators can trust the authenticity of those claims.

The app gamifies professional growth with leaderboards, personalized skill graphs, and skill-based communities. For example, top GitHub contributors or Kaggle Grandmasters can earn exclusive status NFTs and unlock access to elite networking groups, hackathons, or hiring channels.

## Features

### zkTLS Verification
Zero-Knowledge TLS verification ensures your credentials are real without exposing private data. The app connects to platforms like:
- LeetCode
- GitHub
- Kaggle
- HackerRank
- Stack Overflow

### On-Chain Storage
All proofs are stored immutably on the XION blockchain for permanent verification.

### Dynamic NFT Evolution
Skill NFTs upgrade automatically as users improve (e.g., Bronze → Gold).

### Privacy-Friendly Identity
Prove skills anonymously without exposing personal information.

### Passion Index
Tracks developer engagement on Reddit, YouTube, Medium to show curiosity and activity.

### Reputation Score
Earn peer endorsements from teammates, mentors, or open-source maintainers.

### Community & Leaderboards
Join skill-based communities and compete on global leaderboards.
